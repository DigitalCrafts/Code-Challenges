# Code Challenges
These code challenges are designed to encourage students to collaborate while practicing their programming and version control skills.

New challenges will be added at least once a week and announced in Slack.

# How to Participate

Students can work together or make their own file/s. In either case, it is a good idea to create your own branch to work on a new solution.
