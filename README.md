# Code Challenges
These code challenges are designed to encourage students to collaborate while practicing their programming and version control skills.

New challenges will be added at least once a week and announced in Slack.

# How to Participate

Students can work together or make their own file/s. In either case, it is a good idea to create your own branch to work on a new solution. If you would like others to work with you, please add the tag "Open" to your new branch. Conversly, please add "Closed" if you would like to work on your file alone.
