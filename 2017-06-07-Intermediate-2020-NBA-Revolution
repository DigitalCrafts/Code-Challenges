# Description

We are in June 2020 and the [NBA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association) just decided to change the format of their regular season from the [divisions/conferences system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association#Regular_season) to one single round robin tournament.

You are in charge of writing the program that will generate the regular season schedule every year from now on. The NBA executive committee wants the competition to be as fair as possible, so the round robin tournament has to conform with the below rules:

1 - The number of teams engaged is maintained to 30.

2 - The schedule is composed of 58 rounds of 15 games. Each team plays 2 games against the other teams - one at home and the other away - for a total of 58 games. All teams are playing on the same day within a round.

3 - After the first half of the regular season (29 rounds), each team must have played exactly once against all other teams.

4 - Each team cannot play more than 2 consecutive home games, and playing 2 consecutive home games cannot occur more than once during the whole season.

5 - Rule 4 also applies to away games.

6 - The schedule generated must be different every time the program is launched.

# Bonus

Add the scheduled date besides each round number in your output (using format MM/DD/YYYY), given that:

- The competition cannot start before October 1st, 2020 and cannot end after April 30th, 2021.

- There cannot be less than 2 full days between each round (it means that if one round occurs on October 1st, the next round cannot occur before October 4th).

- The number of rounds taking place over the weekends (on Saturdays or Sundays) must be maximized, to increase audience incomes.
